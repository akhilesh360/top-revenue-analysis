## 🎯 Assignment Completion Summary

This repository contains my complete submission for Patrick McCann's Data Scientist assignment, addressing both requirements:

### ✅ **Part 1: Time on Page vs Revenue Analysis**
- **Main Output:** `patrick_mccann_revenue_analysis.pdf` (Executive-ready report)
- **Code Appendix:** `patrick_mccann_assignment.py` (Full analysis code)

### ✅ **Part 2: Public Streamlit Dashboard**
- **Live Demo:** https://share.streamlit.io/akhilesh360/top-revenue-analysis/main/storytelling_dashboard.py
- **Code:** `storytelling_dashboard.py` + `core_analytics.py`

## 📊 Key Findings: Time on Page vs Revenue

### Executive Summary
- **Correlation:** -0.555 (Large negative effect)
- **Statistical Significance:** YES (p < 0.001)
- **Business Impact:** $-0.00019 revenue decrease per additional second
- **Model Performance:** R² improves 175.9% when controlling for browser/platform/site

### What This Means
**Surprising Result:** Longer time on page actually correlates with LOWER revenue. This suggests:
1. **Quality over Quantity:** Users who find what they need quickly convert better
2. **Friction Hypothesis:** Long sessions might indicate user confusion or poor UX
3. **Segmentation Matters:** Browser, platform, and site variables explain 85% of revenue variance

### Business Recommendations
1. **Optimize for Quick Conversions:** Focus on reducing time-to-action
2. **Platform Strategy:** Mobile vs desktop show different patterns
3. **UX Improvement:** Investigate why longer sessions correlate with lower revenue
